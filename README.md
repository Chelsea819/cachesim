# cachesim
This is a simple cache simulator.

If you want to run it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Chelsea819/cachesim.git
make run  // You can see the default test result.
make gdb  // You can debug this simulator in gdb.
```

If you want to change the default test, you can find `void cache_init();` function and change codes.

In addition to the default test, you can also test by pass cmd-line argsuments.
